 Cancer epidemiology in Geneva - 1989-2021
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of cancer epidemiology and trends within the canton of Geneva, utilizing data from the Geneva Cancer Registry for the period 1985-2021. Tumor locations are categorized to generate aggregated statistics by gender, time period, and age group. To account for variability, time is analyzed in three-year intervals.
